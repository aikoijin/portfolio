                       <p>For this next academic year, my plan would attempt to address a variety of problems that have been encountered. First of all, within the club, there is a lack of togetherness and cliques across both the general and officer body. To attempt to combat this I would continue with the monthly meetings/events that I hope would garner members together to create a greater sense of community. Additionally, potential check-ins and officer bonding time may produce a closer level of comradery that would then translate into the body. While it may not be ideal for some, establishing a standard for attendance and participation to ensure active involvement will also be a way to promote community amongst officers. Another way to approach the lack of togetherness would be integrating the competitive side of the club back into the community side as it has been seen to be mostly self-sustainable. Having the competitive parts not be as separated from the general community would allow for more fans to potentially develop and interact with those who represent our school, as well as bring a stronger sense of community that may help to revive certain communities within the club body. Of course, I would check in with each director to see what has and has not been working, but even with the integration, the competitive teams would be taken care of with the necessary resources and support to continue to thrive especially now that we have the space in Baskins. Continuing intramurals is also something that I would want to keep throughout the next year as it could bring a variety of people together. Next, would be addressing the perception of the club as a place for only hardcore gamers as well as being seen as a “boys club”. While that perception does hold in some areas of the club, I think that showcasing a diverse community would take a step toward a more inclusive environment, specifically through displaying a diverse body in the content we make as well as recognizing that this is a safe space. For example, I would continue with the variety style of content we have been recording to showcase the diverse officer body as it may then aid in promoting a wider, more inclusive audience. With the thought of content in mind, participating in trends such as TikToks may show our club to a wider audience with additional sharing across platforms. While I do think our presence on campus is lacking, continuing to promote both regular club activities and competitive events through socials, flyers, and other promotional material is the best that that could do thus far. Working with other clubs as well as the school to showcase our club is also something that may garner more attention, such as coordinating an event with SAMA or GDA. A different example would be working with on-campus artists to create an artist alley event where we could not only get some funding but also open our audience. For further recognition, it has been discussed with some other officers to coordinate a campus-wide gaming event similar to one held across the UCs to focus on collaboration with the community and competitive team, it would be held at each college with a variety of games to compete in and gain points for respective teams. Having smaller social events and fundraisers may additionally garner attention and funding, with an “open house” mindset for people to check out the club. Getting on top of fundraisers and having active participation is another thing I would attempt to address as there is a call for team funding but a lack of willingness to raise the money. Further with the thought of funding in mind producing things such as tote bags and other merchandise with a rebranded design of Slug Gaming is also something I plan to look into as it would get not only money but attention for our club. I hope to be able to work towards these goals the best that I can within the year, thank you for the consideration.</p>

                <p>
                  Keep the split between esports and community since newer members need to know that you don't have to be good to play games.
                  <br><br>
                  Community/event planning<br>
                  There is also a lack of casual gamers. I would want to host a slug gaming minecraft server (preferably on pebblehost). I know that there should be a new update coming out soon on minecraft this year. I'm hoping we can align the upcoming update with this idea. This would be used to see if there are players who are interested outside of the competitive games that slug gaming has right now (eg valorant, lol)
                  Also, in preparation for the spring quarter plan, I would want to host community events in different parts of campus. For example: smash brothers night at crown or just dance night at porter. Doing this can help branch out our club to places besides crown (there's a lot of us from crown). These community nights would most likely be bi-weekly to also have time to fit in intermurals. These events would also need 2-3 officers attending so that if people do show up, they don't feel weirded out by the one guy that's there. If it's possible, I'd try and get Costco pizza (I have a card lmao), people love pizza.
                  Some watch parties aren't necessarily needed, like rocket league. I would probably stick to live streaming for now but not host a watch party unless more interest is apperant(ex valorant/lol). I would use socials like instagram/tiktok comments as a way to figure out interest during the fall quarter to prepare for any watch parties in the winter.
                  <br><br>
                  Socials<br>
                  I would also want to do gamer highlight posts as well. For example: showcase someone's old animal crossing island on Instagram or maybe even a stardew valley farm. They could even be competitions to see who's looks the best. With a $20-$25 prize. Doing this gives let's people know that we like to engage with all gamers and not just try-hard gamers. However there also needs to be a clear distinction between the esports team and the community. I would want to create a sperate social media account dedicated for esports. We can use the collaboration feature of different social media apps to continue to post on the main sug gaming account while also showing that the esports team is the part of the club where "you have to be good at games". Through our social media I would also want to post clips from other content(yt) or even short-form vlogs from community events (that might get people more interested in our community events for when we host a game night at oaks). Also it wouldn't hurt to upload highlights onto tiktok or even make 4 min videos to also upload it to YouTube.
                  I also want to try and do some fundraising for the club as well. I really liked the bingo fundraising that we came up with earlier this winter quarter. It sounds fun and also sounds like something that we can tie into our community events(ex: "pie" an officer[ITS NOT A LITERAL PIE]). My only issue is that our officers aren't exactly the best at communicating.
                  <br><br>
                  Officers<br>
                  While slug gaming is a club that is run by students voluntarily, there is some need for discipline. While I don't want to come off as bossy, I would need to require officers to attend at least one community event a month. If an officer can not accommodate to that requirement I would need to talk to them about what works for them or if they need to step down from their position. I'd rather have a small functional team rather than a group of people who hold an important title that does nothing.
                  But for some fun and excitement, I'd like all the officers to have a game night first weekend available. This can help everyone get an understanding/feel for how if like community game night to be ran. We would also eat pizza ((:
                  Months meetings will still be held, remote options will be given since I've noticed a lot of people tend to not show up....
                  <br><br>
                  Content<br>
                  Preferably, I'd like the content team to be people who live on vampus or have easy access to the school canpus so that everyone is within working range. Obviously start the quarter off with a slug gaming officer Overcooked video. Our upload lineup can also be mixed in with a few game clips/interviews from intermural events/community game night vlogs. I would need to see if I would still be in charge of content or if someone else is in that position. Whichever way it happens, I need to find new editors for videos. I would definitely make posts online and place posters around campus for recruitment. My goal for the content team is to make one video a month and try and make videos under a similar format to OTV(from like 4 yrs ago, their newer stuff is meh). Longer content wouldn't be much of a concern since I want to mainly focus on short form content to get our name around quickly. Content should mainly focus on making 2-5 concept documents a month and find editor recruits so that when winter quarter comes along, they're prepared to make videos. 
                  <br><br>
                  Esports<br>
                  Start off intermurals with LOL and valorant the 2nd week of the fall Quarter. Two weeks later we can move on to a day where we livestream rocket league and maybe splatoon 3 if it's applicable. I'm not entirely sure how the esports side of the club works so I would definitely need more help setting up those events/games</p>

              <div class="column2">
               <p>Through Fall Quarter, in order to support my plan for the club I will continue the general meetings/events but will have some more focused on the general club community and the smaller subsections, and have a few with the open house concept in mind as a means to welcome new people within the club. Additionally, for one of the general events, having one to meet and casually play against some of the competitive team members could be useful in showcasing the talent. Filming content and holding intramurals throughout the quarter will also be part of the Fall Quarter plans as well as introducing and having highlights for the different parts of the club for people to see. Lacing in the officer check ins and bonding will be something throughout this quarter especially as the new academic year starts.</p>

                  Time to push the content team. Based on concept documents that have been made, I would want the content team to shoot twice a month but still release 1 video a month, that way we have something to edit around the spring. We would still keep our content lineup different (as in we try new ideas of content like challenges or even short stories/skits). And like last quarter, keep uploading clips, highlights, interviews, events, etc so that maybe we can get more than one video done in a month (even if it's like 4 min). There would also be about 1 concept document made every 5-ish weeks. I'd prefer the team focus on filming their past ideas.
                  <br><br>
                  Community<br>
                  I'm going to assume that if we were to do game nights at different colleges, we wouldn't be able to get to all of them in one quarter, if we're lucky, half. I would of course start in crown and then to any colleges we missed. Hopefully this grows our community even more for what I have planned in the spring.
                  Depending how the minecraft server goes, I may want to continue it somehow, maybe with like weekly events rather than just a survival world. Similar to MC Mondays but for slug gaming. If the server were to fo poorly, I would drop it and bring back watch parties for the weekends where hopefully there's a little more to do than just watch. Maybe like do fundraising payouts or even advertise fundraising at the events.
                  <br><br>
                  Socials<br>
                  By now, at least 2 new videos should have been released. I would want lead content and lead socials to be working close together so that they can upload their respective content accordingly. If they can, I'd like socials to hop on any trending audio and keep posting gamer highlights from casual games like sims4 or even from our minecraft server. I'm hoping that socials cam help carry newer audiences to our YouTube and club so that we have a bigger following. 
                  
                  Esports<br>
                  I really need more help planning this stuff....
                  With the sperate social media accounts in place, it's not a bad idea to keep posting highlights of intermurals, but also try and be egotistical with the posts similar to ucsd or UCI(they post stuff about awards, just be silly with it!)
                  <br><br>
                  Officers<br>
                  Monthy meetings will still be held, but I will offer meeting arrangements for the weekends in case there is anything that officers may need to discuss with me.</p>

               <p>Within Winter Quarter, it would continue the notions of the variety meetings and content, but will ideally have an artist alley event and/or collaboration with another club for this time of the school year. Showcasing the collaboration could potentially aid in funds as well as recognition. Once again continuing content and check ins would be upheld throughout this quarter as well, and hopefully if the merchandise was not finalized in fall quarter would be available by winter.</p>

                  THE SPRING EVENT<br>
                  THIS is the dream plan, aka everything goes well, perfect even. Now that most colleges have gotten a feel for slug gaming, I'd like to build off of Joy's campus-wide event.
                  All colleges compete against other colleges in different games every other week. The top two colleges with the highest amount of wins will compete against each other in an undisclosed game.
                  The lineup for the games each college team will be competing has not been decided. It will most likely relate to anything that we played when hosting community game nights. (Wii sports is a very good option)
                  Of course, not everything can go according to plan. If for any reason the popularity of the club isn't high enough for a campus-wide event, plan B is to have a slug gaming event instead. Sounds boring buy what can I do....
                  <br><br>
                  Content<br>
                  I'd like to have a requirement a maximum of 2 videos for the quarter. Anything else can be the vlogs or highlights of the spring event. FOCUS ON THE SPRING EVENT!!!

                  Same goes for them, spring event.
                  -Keep posting community spotlights
                  -Trending audio posts is a yes
                  -Try and have our community be in more of our posts, keep things inclusive!

                  LETS MAKE ESPORTS OFFICIAL<br>
                  assuming we have enough members in our club that are having fun....
                  We should petition with the school to see our esports as an official team. We'd have the support of our community to back us up rather than. A small group of goobers running a club.</p>
