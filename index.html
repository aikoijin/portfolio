				<p>Shabti is an Egyptian survival-horror game, where you play as a young mummy that has been entombed in the pyramid and has awaken for unknown reasons and must find a way out to find the truth of your awakening.

				<br><br> In the process of shaping the protagonist, I immersed myself in a thorough exploration of alien facial structures, guided by the endearing charm of League of Legends' Gnar. The challenge lay in capturing that cuteness and infusing an otherworldly essence into our character, a task that demanded meticulous research and creative finesse. To seamlessly integrate our creation into the game's environment, I dedicated extensive study to various Egyptian patterns, clothing styles, and intricate jewelry, aiming to achieve a harmonious and culturally resonant design.

				<br><br> When it came to crafting the protagonist's weaponry, I delved deeper into historical contexts, seeking inspiration that would not only complement the character but also contribute to the game's overall narrative. The Scarab emerged as a recurring motif, meticulously integrated into the design, symbolizing both cultural significance and narrative depth. Bandages and a rugged, worn texture became integral elements, adding layers of authenticity and character history to the visual narrative.

				</p>

				<p>Starstruck is a 2D verse-jumping platformer game that places the player into many parts of the universe to collect the 6 pieces of the star and reunite them to win the game.

				<br><br> In my work, I drew inspiration from League of Legends' champion designs particularly Yone & Yasuo and incorporated it into the character design. My love for Chinese clothing and architecture was my core inspiration for my level design and character cohesiveness that I decided on. I did multiple research on Chinese buildings and tried to grasp their elegant yet bold curved roofs, and glass windows along with the red columns.
				
				<br><br> In my level design I played with the idea of parkour and roof running as my core gameplay. I wanted to do wall jumping but time did not allow it so I opted for a platform jumping to mimic the action of wall jumping in my game. I was trying to express with my choices of level/design a feeling of nostalgia similar to the Subway Surfer type of gameplay where you run on trains but mix it in with more of my culture (as a Chinese American myself). In a way, I also wanted the player to also be captivated by the artwork and less on the difficulty of reaching the star.

				</p>

				<p>9-Tales is a simple 2D platformer game based off of Yoko Ono's "Grapefruit: Beat Piece," particularly the directive to "listen to a heart beat,". The deliberate clunkiness of the game mechanics was not only unintentional but also served to intensify the experience, creating a palpable sense of adrenaline as players narrowly missed platforms or barely landed on them with just one foot, emphasizing the beating of the heart. I aimed to express the idea of perseverance and the fear of the unknown, encapsulated in the concept of having limited chances to reach a goal.

				<p>My favorite game is League of Legends as I have been an avid player of the game since 2016. I really love how there are a variety of champions that you can choose from and play since it doesn’t limit you to one choice and allows you to find the champion that suits your skill level and playstyle. I also love Riot’s semi-realism style and immaculate character development with each skinline referencing multiple cultural days and apparel. For example, Heavenscale is based on 2024: Year of the Dragon, La Illusion is based on Day of the Dead, Lunar New Year is based on Chinese New Year, Heartbreakers/Sweetheart is based on Valentine’s Day, Immortal Journey is based on xianxias/immortal heroes in Chinese fantasy,etc. By incorporating multiple skinlines based on different cultures, players feel a sense of belonging when they see their traditions being represented in skinlines for champions that they can play and associate themselves with.
